This repository contains a Python script that generates an animation demonstrating the process of resolving edge crossings in a bipartite graph using the Hungarian method. The script creates two sets of points (representing nodes), connects them with edges, and iteratively resolves any edge crossings by swapping endpoints. The resulting animation visualizes the process step-by-step.
